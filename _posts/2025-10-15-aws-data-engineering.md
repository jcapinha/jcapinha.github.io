Over the past few years working with BMW Group, I've had the opportunity to work on several large-scale data engineering projects. In this post, I'll share some key insights and lessons learned from building data pipelines on AWS.

## The Challenge

When dealing with vehicle telemetry data, we faced several challenges:
- Processing massive amounts of real-time data
- Ensuring data quality and consistency
- Optimizing costs while maintaining performance
- Building maintainable and scalable systems

## Key Solutions

### 1. Apache Iceberg for Data Lake Management

One of the most impactful decisions we made was implementing Apache Iceberg. This helped us:
- Optimize query performance
- Manage schema evolution
- Improve data lake metadata handling

### 2. Real-time Processing with Apache Kafka

Using Kafka allowed us to:
- Handle high-throughput data streams
- Ensure reliable message delivery
- Decouple data producers and consumers

## Lessons Learned

1. Start with good data modeling
2. Invest in monitoring and observability
3. Consider cost implications early
4. Build for maintainability
