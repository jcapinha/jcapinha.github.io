        <div class="section-content">
            <p>When I studied Marketing Management, I was always curious about how things worked, especially where the data that informed most marketing decisions came from and how it could be gathered. This curiosity led me down an unconventional path of teaching myself Python, diving into data engineering, and eventually building a career in data, even when close people like my parents questioned whether I was straying from what I studied for.</p>
            <ul class="highlights">
                
                <li>Self-taught Python programmer and data engineer</li>
                
                <li>Stayed close to code: Despite not coding daily recently, I remained deeply involved in architecture decisions for tech-intensive backend systems</li>
                
                <li>Ready to return: My strong technical foundation is intact, and I'm ready to put my hands back to work with some refreshing needed</li>
                
                <li>Natural evolution: Even as an engineer, I always kept a foot in product development, which led to my Product Owner role</li>

            <p>When it comes to technology applied to things I love, I easily get into deep rabbit holes, trying to understand the technical details as much as I can.
